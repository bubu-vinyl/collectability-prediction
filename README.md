# Learning the impact of social, psychological and physical attributes on vinyl record collectibility with neural networks
Vinyl records as a music format has made an unprecedented
comeback in recent years. Unsurprisingly, vinyl records have outsold
CDs for the first time in the United States in 2021 (Nover, 2022).
Moreover, the interest is still ever-growing, causing shortages at vinyl
pressing plants and pushing wait times to over 9 months. As a result,
Jack White made a statement for the music industry and called for
building more pressing plants (White, 2022).
In the study, empirical evidence was found on the impact of
attributes that goes well beyond the artist or title popularity in ex-
plaining the popularity of vinyl records. Specifically, unique physical
attributes to the iconic format from Discogs.com marketplace were
used along with expert reviews on Pitchfork.com and Rolling Stone
magazines and metrics explaining the perceived mood on music from
Spotify on albums were investigated by comparing random forest and neural network algorithms in regression. The results demon-
strate significant positive contributions of all three data sources in
predicting the collectability of a vinyl release with an R2 of 0.68 and
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.36% on the 10,000 most
collected vinyl releases.
